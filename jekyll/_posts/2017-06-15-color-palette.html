  Well, I can't say that this palette generator pen is my original idea because
  I got the design inspiration <a href="http://coolors.co" target="_blank">from another palette generator website</a>,
  but I definitely coded it myself. There were several cool features about that
  site that I wanted to emulate:
  <!--end excerpt-->
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    5 colors vertically positioned across the screen
  </li>
  <li>
    Random generation with the click of a button
  </li>
  <li>
    Several themes to choose from (monochromatic, triad, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to adjust hue, saturation, etc
  </li>
  <li>
    Drag and drop colors around
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So I used several JavaScript tools (<a href="http://jscolor.com">jscolor</a>
  for the color picker, <a href="https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor/">tinycolor</a>
  for manipulation of the colors in JavaScript, and <a href="http://jquery.com">jquery</a>
  for drag-and-drop) to build a functional sort-of replica that I can now use for
  picking a color scheme for future projects.
</p>
<p>
  I did add two extra features that I really like: the sliding bar on the right
  side lets you use the buttons to adjust the color settings by any percentage
  you want, and the animate button generates new colors every 2 seconds (but
  that setting can be changed). Really awesome! :)
