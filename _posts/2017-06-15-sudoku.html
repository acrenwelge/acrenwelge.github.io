  This pen has been the hardest coding project for me yet! I got the idea of
  writing a sudoku game that can generate a board and check the user's solution
  after trying a hard sudoku problem while having lunch with my math professor, Dr. Yasskin.
  <!--end excerpt-->
</p>
<p>
  I began by writing the HTML and CSS to display the board, which is organized
  into 3 horizontal rows which each contain 3 squares, which each contain 9 cells.
  There is also a bar of numbers below the board which can be used to insert
  numbers into the board.
</p>
<p>
  After the UI was built to my satisfaction, I started thinking about the board
  generation code. I decided to represent the board as a 2D array (although
  later I realized I could have simply used a 1D array). I generated the board
  randomly by taking a solved board (it could be a very simple board, like
  [1 2 3 ...etc]) and permuting the row groups, column groups, and the rows
  and columns within each group. This jumbles the board but ensures it remains
  valid. Then, I wrote a function to randomly mask 5 cells in each square.
</p>
<p>
  Now came the hard part: writing the board solver function. I actually ended
  up writing two different solver functions, one as a brute force algorithm
  and one as a "smarter" algorithm.
</p>
<p>
  The brute force method starts with a 1 in the first open cell and checks for
  validity in ascending numerical order before moving onto the next open cell.
  If no number is valid for the cell, it retreats to the previous cell and
  increments the cell value. As you can imagine, this takes a long time for
  certain board configurations, but at least it guarantees to find a solution
  if one exists. The "smarter" algorithm uses essentially the same method, but
  it first eliminates some of the solution board possibilities by checking the
  adjacent row, square, and column cells for each cell.
</p>

  Finally, after many strenuous hours of debugging, my project was finished:
