I wanted to post a quick update on my command-line tool project for fetching cryptocurrency data. I found the original Java implementation to be too unwieldy and verbose, and I wanted to get more Python experience, so I [ported the project over](https://github.com/acrenwelge/cryptocli-python).

<!--end excerpt-->

I have implemented almost all the same features as the original project in fewer lines of code. I also [released the project to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocli/) for others to easily install via `pip`.  I plan to keep building new features on the Python version while the original Java project is put on the backburner.
