I recently conducted a "tech talk" at work where I dove into cool things you can do
with the command line. I talked about:
* advanced linux and bash commands
* using a command line editor (vim)
* configuration files for vim and bash
* configuring and invoking the AWS CLI
* fun stuff with `cowsay` and `genact`
<!--end excerpt-->

Most people don't realize just how powerful you can make your command line tools
and environment with just a little work. I keep all of my dotfiles for environment
configuration and personal scripts for useful tasks in [this repo](https://github.com/acrenwelge/bash-stuff).
Whenever I make a change to my environment, I save it in a config file and
push it. Then, whenever I am working somewhere new (a new laptop or VM), I can simply
clone the repo and run my custom install script - and just like that, I have
my environment and command line tools ready to go!

One note here: since I use a Mac for personal use but I have a Windows work laptop,
my bash script detects which OS it is running in and customizes the environment
configuration to it.

So feel free to steal, fork, or borrow ideas from my dotfiles and scripts to create
your own personal environment setup.
