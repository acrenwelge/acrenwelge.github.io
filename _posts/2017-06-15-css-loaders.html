  I've always found CSS to be quite powerful for performing smooth animations
  so after messing around with various <code>@keyframe</code> animations on Codepen,
  I thought I'd make some loader animations.

<p>
  First I tried a basic thin taurus with a quarter chunk of it colored in and
  rolling around it. I added another quarter on the opposite side for the next
  animation, and then half of the taurus for the third.
</p>
<p>
  Next, I experimented with animating three dots, floating up in order, fading in
  and out, and circling around a point in various manners. A simple change of
  the <code>animation-direction</code> and <code>animation-timing-function</code>
  CSS properties changes each animation dramatically, and many different
  animations can be shown by combinations of these properties.

  The last type of spinner was inspired by Google's chrome logo, with yellow,
  red, green, and blue as four different layers of color. I especially enjoyed
  the spinners where the layers merge and separate, creating a cool overlapping
  effect.
