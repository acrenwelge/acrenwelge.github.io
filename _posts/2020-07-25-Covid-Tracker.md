title: 'Website for COVID-19 Tracking'
---
When the global pandemic started earlier this year, I saw many people trying to make sense of the disease, writing blog posts and doing statistical analyses of the (limited) data we had. So I thought it would be a good use of my coding skills to make a simple website to track and visualize cases in the U.S.

I used the <a href="https://covidtracking.com">COVID Tracking API</a> along with plain old Javascript for data manipulation, and Chart.js to visualize the results. I built a very simple regression model which could predict case numbers into the future.
