  This was one of the first pages I built on codepen. The concept is simple - there is a
  field for entering search terms and a search button to get the results. There is also
  a "random article" button that will open a random Wikipedia page.

  Making the UI was simple - two button and a search field. I also added background
  highlighting when hovering for the search results.
</p>
<p>
  On the Javascript side, I used jQuery to store variables and open a simple AJAX
  request to the Wikipedia API. Getting the query string from the input field was as simple as
  <code>var $keywords = $('#query').get(0).value</code>. An ajax call is submitted with
  jQuery's <code>$.ajax({...})</code>. In the "success" parameter of the object passed to
  the ajax call, I wrote a callback function that gets all of the relevant data out of the JSON
  object that is returned and displays them in a list below the search field. There is
  even a snippet of each page as a preview displayed below the titles.
</p>
<p>
  Implementing the random page button was even simpler. It's simply a link to
  a URL on wikipedia that directs to a random page: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random".
